    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><strong>Speaking in Code</strong> is an <a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh">NEH-funded</a> symposium and summit that will bring together approximately 20 accomplished digital humanities software developers at the University of Virginia Library <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a>. Together, we will give voice to what is almost always tacitly expressed in our work: expert knowledge about the intellectual and interpretive dimensions of DH code-craft, and unspoken understandings about the relation of that work to ethics, scholarly method, and humanities theory.</p>
	<p>Over the course of two days in November 2013, participants will:
		<ul>
			<li>reflect on and express, from developers' own points of view, what is particular to the humanities and of scholarly significance in DH software development products and practices;</li>
			<li>and collaboratively devise an action-oriented agenda to bridge the gaps in critical vocabulary and discourse norms that can frequently distance creators of humanities platforms or tools from the scholars who use and critique them.</li>
		</ul></p>
    <p>This will be the first focused meeting to address the implications of tacit knowledge exchange in the digital humanities. Watch this space and follow <a href="http://twitter.com/scholarslab">@ScholarsLab</a> for outcomes from <strong>Speaking in Code</strong>.</p>

    <h1>Call for Participants</h1>
    <p><strong>Speaking in Code</strong> participants will be selected on the basis of their demonstrated experience in digital humanities software development, their interest in advancing solutions to the problems raised by the summit, and the disciplinary and cultural diversity they bring to the conversation. All applicants are welcome, but we particularly encourage and will prioritize participation of developers who are women, people of color, LGBTQ, or from other under-represented groups.</p>
	<p><strong>Apply by September 12th</strong> for best consideration.</p>

<section id="agenda">
    <h1>Agenda</h1>
    <p>We start from the premise that humanities software development holds more in common with traditional arts-and-crafts practice than with academic discourse, and that its methods and assumptions may embed a valuable, largely non-verbal new hermeneutic of “making.” The <strong>Speaking in Code</strong> program calls on five respected, versatile, and motivated experts in the field to help participants articulate—from their own vantage points—whether and to what degree tacit humanities knowledge is embedded in DH developers’ craft, and to outline the new scholarly and methodological understandings that may be emergent from their praxis.</p>
	<p>The second part of the summit will be a unconference-style “Development Day,” designed to foster grassroots leadership among participants and seed collaborative projects that may be technical or social in nature. Projects pitched on the second day are meant to address the larger goals of <strong>Speaking in Code</strong> and the most practicable and potentially transformative among them may be undertaken by the <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a> and new partners after the summit ends.</p>

						<p><strong>Activity</strong>: Brainstorming a working list of areas in which tacit understanding and hands-on journeyman learning experiences make it difficult for scholars and junior developers to engage with the theoretical side of DH code craft.

This presentation will address the division that can occur between design and development, even in humanities projects in which design elements take on particular rhetorical or interpretive significance.</p>

Dr. <strong>Hugh Cayless</strong> will present approaches to semantics and structures in XML data and their representations in other formats.</p>

                    <p>Little conversation takes place among developers, across digital humanities projects, on decision-making with regard to uniformity or incongruity of data. Dr. <strong>Tim Sherratt</strong> will discuss the process by which he decides to support or disregard “edge cases” in data-mining within existing cultural heritage resources, and the manner in which decisions about ambiguous or contradictory information can affect ongoing database design and development.</p>
					<p><strong>Discussion</strong>: Share your own stories. How have you worked to incorporate ambiguity or contradictory evidence in humanities computing projects? When have you decided to elide it, why, and with what impact on the scholarly arguments your tool enabled?

    <h1>Logistics</h1>
    <h2>Times and Dates</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Speaking in Code</strong> program will run for two full days, 4-5 November 2013. Participants should plan to arrive in Charlottesville on the evening of Sunday, November 3rd. A casual, social event will be planned for early arrivals! We will conclude by 5pm on Tuesday.</p>
    <h2>Location & Directions</h2>
    <p>If you are driving to the Charlottesville area, you will probably want <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/Map/">Maps &amp; Directions</a> to the University of Virginia. Our local airport is <a href="http://www.gocho.com/">CHO</a>, a short taxi ride to the north of town. Charlottesville is approximately 110 miles and two hours south of Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab">Scholars' Lab</a> is located in Alderman Library, behind the café on the main floor (4 West).  View the Scholars' Lab and Alderman Library (and relationship to parking) <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214746544792154569224.0004bad534c15770e9ddd&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=38.038154,-78.502883&amp;spn=0.005797,0.013937">on a Google map</a>.</p>

    <h2>Lodging</h2>
    <p>Look here for conference rates for hotels soon. The <a href="http://www.cavalierinn.com/">Cavalier Inn</a>, <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/chodt-courtyard-charlottesville-university-medical-center/">Courtyard Marriott</a>, and <a href="http://redroof-uva.com/">Red Roof Inn</a> are local, walkable, affordable options.</p>
    <h2>Travel Bursaries</h2>
    <p>Through the generosity of the NEH <a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh">Office of Digital Humanities</a> and the <a href="http://library.virginia.edu">University of Virginia Library</a>, we have up to $10,000 in bursaries to award on the basis of need and to promote diversity among <strong>Speaking in Code</strong> participants. This funding is meant to offset the cost of travel, lodging, any meals that are not provided, and/or lost wages by hourly or freelance developers. If you would like to be considered for funding, please fill out the relevant section of the application form, above.</p>
</section>
<section id="inclusivity">
    <h1>You Are Welcome Here</h1>
    <p>This is a small planning and problem-scoping meeting, meant to provide an opportunity for advanced software developers to address shared issues in DH and tacit knowledge&mdash;on their own terms. Participants are therefore expected to have contributed to digital humanities software projects at an intermediate or expert level, committing code or with responsibility for aspects of design, architecture, and technical project management that indicates past experience can be brought to bear.</p> 
	<p>However, because software development&mdash;even in the more intellectually diverse and welcoming digital humanities&mdash;is a predominantly white and male profession, we are particularly committed to amplifying the voices of developers who are women, people of color, queer/LGBT, or otherwise under-represented among programmers, and to creating a friendly and respectful environment for collaboration at this event. Don't let <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a> stop you from applying to <strong>Speaking in Code</strong>! If you have questions about your application, would like to nominate other participants, or have advice to share, please get in touch with the <a href="mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu">whole organizing group</a> or with <a href="mailto:nowviskie@gmail.com">the grant's PI</a> directly.</p>
	<p>If interest in <strong>Speaking in Code</strong> greatly exceeds our funding and local capacity, the Scholars' Lab will explore options for remote participation. (And future <strong>Speaking in Code</strong> events may be geared toward novice developers or members of the scholarly user community for DH platforms and tools.)
